Mark was born in Fort Collins, Colorado. He didn't live there for very long though.
He was abducted by the muppets at a very early age and spent most of his life on the run wtih a whole
crew of sentient puppets.

When he's not evading the authorities (and television producers) he enjoys hiking, painting, and making websites.
